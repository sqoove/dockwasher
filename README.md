![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

Powerful and **destructive** bash script that **removes all Docker containers, images, volumes, and networks** from your system. It's designed to give you a completely clean Docker environment — useful when you're troubleshooting, starting fresh, or reclaiming disk space.

> **WARNING:** This script will **delete all your Docker data** irreversibly. Use with extreme caution.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neoslabx/dockwasher.git
cd dockwasher
```

2. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x dockwasher.sh
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
./docker-cleanup.sh
```

4. Confirm when prompted:

```
WARNING: This will delete ALL Docker data!
Are you sure? (y/N): y
```

* * *

## Requirements

* Docker must be installed and running
* Bash shell (Linux/macOS or WSL on Windows)

* * *

### Safety Mechanism

The script includes a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental execution:

```bash
read -p "Are you sure? (y/N): " confirm
```

Only if you respond with `y` (lowercase) will the cleanup proceed.

### Disclaimer

This script is **irreversible**. Once executed, **all data** managed by Docker on your system **will be lost**.

Use only when you're absolutely sure you want to wipe your Docker environment.
